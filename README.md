# BuildItBigger - Android Nanodegree 4th Project

The goal of this project is to create an app that depends on a backend, based on 
Google Compute Engine, which serves data to the app.

Tasks which had to be completed:
- modify the backend module to pop data (in our case a joke) for the app
- create a java library to store the joke
- create an android library to display the joke from the java library in an intent
- asynctask based data fetching and its endpoint test
- flavors for free (has ad) and paid (no ad) apps.
